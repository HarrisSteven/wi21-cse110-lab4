* Both num1 and num2 are of type String. When they are added together, they are actually being concatenated, resulting in a sum that is also of type String that is just the two concatenated strings.

* I would fix it by converting the type of num1 and num2 to Number; 
* let result = Number(num1) + Number(num2)
